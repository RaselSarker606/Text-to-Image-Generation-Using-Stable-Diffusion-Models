📖 Text-to-Image Generation Using Stable Diffusion Models





📖 Overview :

----------------

◕  This project utilizes the Stable Diffusion XL model from Stability AI to generate and modify images based on text prompts. Stable Diffusion is a powerful Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) that leverages deep learning techniques for high-quality image generation.



📂 Features :

----------------

◕  Text-to-Image Generation: Converts textual descriptions into detailed images.

◕  High-Resolution Outputs: Generates high-quality images with intricate details.

◕  Refinement Capability: Uses a secondary model for improved image quality.

◕  Optimized for GPU: Supports CUDA acceleration for faster inference.



🛠️ Methodology :

---------------------

◕  Model Selection & Setup

◕  Uses stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 model.

◕  Implements DiffusionPipeline for efficient inference.

Environment Configuration

◕  Installs required libraries: diffusers, transformers, accelerate, etc.

◕  Loads the Stable Diffusion model with FP16 precision for performance optimization.

◕  Image Generation Pipeline

◕  Takes a text prompt and an optional negative prompt.

◕  Processes the input using latent diffusion techniques.

◕  Outputs a generated image using matplotlib.



🚀 Installation & Usage :

----------------------------

Install dependencies:

pip install diffusers transformers accelerate safetensors matplotlib

Run the script:

python generate_image.py

Input a text prompt and receive an AI-generated image.



📌 Future Improvements :

-----------------------------

◕  Fine-Tuning: Train on custom datasets for domain-specific image generation.

◕  Multi-Modal Input: Integrate text and image conditioning for enhanced results.

◕  Cloud Deployment: Deploy as an API for real-time image generation.
